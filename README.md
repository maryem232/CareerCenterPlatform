🔍📈👨‍💼 In this project, we developed a recommendation system for job seekers that utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation algorithms to provide personalized job recommendations. We also combined these two approaches into a hybrid recommendation system to further improve the accuracy of our recommendations.

To enhance the job-seeking experience, we also developed a feature that compares the job seeker's resume to those of similar users and highlights the missing skills. Based on these missing skills, we recommended courses from Coursera and Udemy to help the job seeker improve their skills and increase their chances of landing their desired job.

We evaluated the performance of our recommendation system by comparing the recommended jobs to the actual jobs accepted by the job seekers. Our results showed that our recommendation system achieved high accuracy and precision in job recommendations.

Overall, this project highlights the potential of recommendation systems in job seeking and the importance of personalized recommendations based on individual skills and preferences. 🤝💼👨‍💻
